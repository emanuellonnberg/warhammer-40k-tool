Each time an attack is made with such a weapon, if that attack scores a Critical Wound, no saving throw of any kind can be made against that attack (including invulnerable saving throws). Such attacks are only allocated to models after all other attacks made by the attacking unit have been allocated and resolved. After that attack is allocated and after any modifiers are applied, it inflicts a number of mortal wounds on the target equal to the Damage characteristic of that attack, instead of inflicting damage normally.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="4b3d-3803-42d2-a628" name="Servo-arc claw" hidden="false" typeId="8a40-4aaa-c780-9046" typeName="Melee Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="914c-b413-91e3-a132">Melee</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="2337-daa1-6682-b110">3</characteristic><characteristic name="WS" typeId="95d1-95f-45b4-11d6">4+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="ab33-d393-96ce-ccba">8</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="41a0-1301-112a-e2f2">-2</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="3254-9fe6-d824-513e">2</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="893f-9000-ccf7-648e">Anti-Vehicle 4+, Devastating Wounds</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles><categories><category id="ccdd-3987-11ed-90cd" name="Melee Weapon" entryId="ccdd-3987-11ed-90cd" primary="false" /></categories></selection></selections><costs><cost name="pts" typeId="51b2-306e-1021-d207" value="45" /></costs><categories><category id="5441-b72-c2ad-f28a" name="Technoarcheologist" entryId="5441-b72-c2ad-f28a" primary="false" /><category id="aff3-d6a3-2a95-9dc" name="Imperium" entryId="aff3-d6a3-2a95-9dc" primary="false" /><category id="5418-f86b-6e76-c5a" name="Faction: Adeptus Mechanicus" entryId="5418-f86b-6e76-c5a" primary="false" /><category id="59a9-b5cc-7c11-aaad" name="Tech-Priest" entryId="59a9-b5cc-7c11-aaad" primary="false" /><category id="9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c" entryId="9cfd-1c32-585f-7d5c" name="Character" primary="true" /><category id="cf47-a0d7-7207-29dc" name="Infantry" entryId="cf47-a0d7-7207-29dc" primary="false" /><category id="6d46-7883-e5d1-45ee" name="Cult Mechanicus" entryId="6d46-7883-e5d1-45ee" primary="false" /></categories></selection><selection id="b3g2k8d" name="Skitarii Rangers" entryId="cb4c-b9a7-a9fd-b2de::de59-f65c-181a-8509" number="1" type="unit" from="entry"><rules><rule id="ada6-bac1-ffe0-d6f7" name="Scouts 6&quot;" hidden="false" page="39"><description>Some units have ‘Scouts x&quot;’ listed in their abilities.
