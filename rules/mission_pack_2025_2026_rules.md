**INTRODUCTION**
Welcome to the Champter Approved Tournament Companion!
The following guidelines are designed to suppor t organisers of
Warhammer 40,000 events in delivering a fine-tuned tournament
experience using the _Chapter Approved Mission Deck_. That product
offers great scope for all kinds of matched play, and its many
variables create a dizzying array of potential missions – thousands,
in fact! Some of these are par ticularly well suited to the most hotly
contested scenarios, and this pack provides suggestions for the best
event configurations. We have also taken the oppor tunity to optimise
cer tain Core Rules concepts for tournament play.

This document provides a ready-made framework for levelling the
playing field and get ting games under way quickly, whether you are
planning your first matched play event or have years of experience
organising the largest and most acclaimed tournaments. Its
recommendations will be followed in full at most Games Workshop
matched play events, and are considered the official way to play
Warhammer 40,000 in a tournament set ting, but can be adapted
to suit your own circumstances – the terrain layout advice is
aimed primarily at newer organisers, for example, and those with
large established terrain collections should feel free to interpret
it accordingly.

The recommendations are presented as follows:

■ **Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Sequence:** Adjustments to
the steps players would normally follow to generate a mission and
prepare the battlefield.
■ **Chapter Approved Mission Deck Errata & FAQ:** Updates to certain
cards and answers to frequently asked questions.
■ **Chapter Approved Tournament Mission Pool:** 20 recommended
tournament rounds to draw from, with pre-set Primary Missions
and deployment modes that put all players on an equal footing and
minimise pre-game admin.
■ **Terrain Layouts:** A suite of carefully designed terrain setups to
be used in conjunction with the Chapter Approved Tournament
Mission Pool.
■ **Pairings and Rankings:** Advice for fairly pairing players and
determining rankings.

**Designer’s Note:** _This document does not use the full contents of your
Chapter Approved Mission Deck; it has been written to provide the
best experience for strangers to play a pick-up game or face off in an
event. For this reason we have not included the Asymmetric War cards
and the Twist cards, which are both left for pick-up-and-play games
where you can plan and prepare. In addition, this document assumes
you will be playing Strike Force sized games; as such, the layouts
are designed to be used with the Strike Force Deployment cards. We
recommend that tournament organisers who wish to run an Incursion
event should adjust these layouts as appropriate._

```
CHAPTER APPROVED TOURNAMENT MISSION
SEQUENCE
A Chapter Approved Tournament Mission bat tle is waged by following
the sequence below.
```
###### 1 MUSTER ARMIES Muster armies as described in the Core Rules.

###### 2 DETERMINE MISSION Instead of shuffling and drawing from the Deployment

```
and Primary Mission decks, players should use the
pre-generated missions from the Chapter Approved
Tournament Mission Pool. Set aside the Secondary Mission
and Challenger cards decks as normal (players will receive
these later).
```
###### 3 READ MISSION Read the Primary Mission. The Primary Mission card details

```
how and when you score Victory points (VP), and may also
apply additional conditions to the bat tle. You can also score
VP by achieving Secondary Missions and Challenger cards
(described later). Twist cards will not be used.
```
###### 4 PLACE OBJECTIVE MARKERS Players now set up objective markers on the bat tlefield.

```
Each Deployment card’s deployment map will show
players how many objective markers to set up and where
each should be placed. In Chapter Approved Tournament
Missions, models can end any type of move on top of an
objective marker.
Designer’s Note: In the Warhammer 40,000 Core Rules,
objective markers are physical artefacts that models cannot
end a move on, representing vital data caches, xenos relics,
Chaos portals or anything else that suits your narrative.
While this adds to the cinematic nature of the battlefield and
offers exciting hobby opportunities, it can sometimes result
in model-positioning circumstances that not everyone will
enjoy equally. As such, these guidelines recommend treating
objective markers as flat, circular markers 40mm in diameter
that offer no impediment to the movement or placement
of models.
```
###### 5 CREATE THE BATTLEFIELD Players now create the bat tlefield and set up terrain

```
features. Missions are played on rectangular bat tlefields
whose dimensions are approximately 44" by 60". When
set ting up terrain features, use the guidelines detailed in the
Terrain Layouts section of this pack. Players must use the
rules for terrain features detailed in the Core Rules. While
other approaches to terrain layout may work within the
collections of experienced organisers, we recommend these
terrain guidelines when otherwise in doubt.
```
## CHAPTER APPROVED

## TOURNAMENT COMPANION

###### VERSION 1.


###### 6 DETERMINE ATTACKER AND DEFENDER Look at the Deployment card drawn and agree which

```
edges of your bat tlefield are the At tacker ’s and Defender ’s
bat tlefield edges. Roll off: the winner decides who will be the
At tacker and who will be the Defender.
```
###### 7 SELECT SECONDARY MISSIONS

```
Secondary Mission cards detail additional ways to score
VP, and must be used either as Fixed or Tactical Missions.
Players now secretly note down whether they will use
Fixed or Tactical Missions; if using Fixed Missions, they
must also note down which two Fixed Missions they will
use (see below). Players then reveal these decisions and
proceed accordingly.
```
**FIXED MISSIONS
Fixed Missions are goals that remain throughout the battle, and can
be achieved multiple times.**

Fixed Missions are those marked with the symbol shown on
the lef t. Af ter revealing the two Fixed Missions you will use, set
aside the remainder of your Secondary Mission deck (it will not
be needed during the bat tle). Your selected Fixed Mission cards
cannot be discarded for any reason other than the Adapt or Die
Mission Rule card.

**TACTICAL MISSIONS
Tactical Missions are replenished at the start of your Command
phase, and are discarded once achieved.**

Af ter revealing that you will use Tactical Missions, shuffle your
Secondary Mission deck.

**If you are using Tactical Missions:**

■ At the start of your first Command phase, draw two cards from your
Secondary Mission deck; those two Secondary Mission cards are
active for you until you achieve them. At the start of each of your
subsequent Command phases, if you have fewer than two active
Secondary Mission cards, draw from your Secondary Mission deck
until you have two active Secondary Mission cards.
■ At the end of your Command phase, you can spend CP to use the
New Orders Stratagem below.
**NEW ORDERS
CORE – STRATEGIC PLOY STRATAGEM**
_High command has received new intelligence._
**WHEN:** End of your Command phase.
**TARGET:** One of your active Secondary
Mission cards.
**EFFECT:** Discard it and draw one new Secondary
Mission card.

At the end of each player ’s turn, each player using Tactical Missions
does the following, star ting with the player whose turn it is:

■ First, if you scored 1 or more VP from a Secondary Mission card,
discard that Secondary Mission card – it is achieved.
■ Then, you can discard one or more of your active Secondary Mission
cards. If you do, and it is your turn, you gain 1CP.
■ If your Secondary Mission deck runs out, you cannot generate any
additional Secondary Missions during the battle.

###### 8 DECL ARE BATTLE FORMATIONS Players secretly note down which of their Leader units will

```
star t the bat tle at tached to which Bodyguard units, which
of their units will star t the bat tle embarked within which
Transports , and which of their units will star t the bat tle
in Reser ves (including Strategic Reser ves). Players then
reveal these decisions.
```
```
RESERVES RESTRICTIONS
■ No more than half of the units in your army can start the battle
in Reserves, and the points total of those units cannot be more
than half of the points total of your army (units embarked within
a Transport that is set up in Reserves also count towards
these limits).
■ Reserves units cannot arrive on the battlefield during the first
battle round (excluding units placed into Strategic Reserves during
the battle).
■ Any Reserves units that have not arrived on the battlefield by the
end of the third battle round count as having been destroyed, as
do any units embarked within them (excluding units placed into
Strategic Reserves during the battle).
```
###### 9 DEPLOY ARMIES Players take it in turns to set up their remaining units one at

```
a time, star ting with the Defender. A player ’s models must be
set up wholly within their deployment zone. If a player sets
up a Ti ta nic unit when it is their turn to set up a unit, they
skip their next turn to set up a unit. If one player finishes
deploying all of their units, their opponent then deploys the
remainder of their units.
```
```
10 REDEPLOY UNITS
Some rules allow players to redeploy cer tain units af ter both
armies are deployed. Unless other wise stated, such rules
are resolved in this step. Players alternate resolving any
such rules, star ting with the At tacker.
```
```
11 DETERMINE FIRST TURN
Roll off: the winner takes the first turn.
```
```
12 RESOLVE PRE-BATTLE RULES
Players alternate resolving any pre-bat tle rules units from
their army may have, star ting with the player who will take
the first turn.
```
```
13 BEGIN THE BATTLE
The first bat tle round begins. Players continue to resolve
battle rounds until the battle ends.
CHALLENGER CARDS
A player becomes the Challenger if, at the star t of the bat tle round,
they have fewer VP than their opponent, and the difference between
their VP totals is 6 or more. That player remains the Challenger until
the end of the bat tle round. While you are the Challenger, draw one
Challenger card at the star t of your Command phase. Each Challenger
card presents one Stratagem and one Mission. You can complete
the Mission, or you can use the card as a Stratagem – you cannot do
both. Note that both players use the same deck of Challenger cards.
```
```
14 END THE BATTLE
The bat tle ends af ter five bat tle rounds have been
completed. Even if one player has no models remaining in
their army at the star t of their turn, players continue to play
out their turns until the bat tle ends.
```
```
1CP
```

```
ACTIONS
Your forces can attempt daring battlefield tasks to
turn the conflict in your favour.
Some cards feature Actions that cer tain units can perform. Each
Action states which units can perform it, when it is star ted and
completed, and what the effects of completing it are.
A unit cannot star t to perform an Action if one or more of the
following apply to that unit:
■ It is an Aircraft unit.
■ It is Battle-shocked.
■ It has an Objective Control characteristic of 0.
■ It is within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units
(unless it is a Titanic Character unit).
■ It Advanced or Fell Back this turn.
■ It is not eligible to shoot this phase (including units that have
already been selected to shoot this phase).
If a unit star ts to perform an Action, until that Action is
completed or until the end of the turn (whichever is later), that
unit is not eligible to shoot or declare a charge (if it is a Ti ta nic
Character unit, that unit cannot star t to perform another
Action and is not eligible to declare a charge instead).
If a unit performing an Action makes a move (excluding Pile-in
and Consolidation moves) or leaves the bat tlefield, that Action
cannot be completed.
```
```
15 DETERMINE VICTOR
At the end of the bat tle, the player with the most VP is the
winner. If the players are tied, the bat tle is a draw.
The maximum VP each player can score is 100VP. Each
player scores 10VP if their army is painted to a Bat tle Ready
standard. The maximum VP that can be scored from each
source of VP is detailed on below. In all cases, any excess VP
awarded above these maximums are lost.
VP SOURCE MAXIMUM VP
Primary Mission 50VP
Secondary Missions 40VP* 90VP**
Challenger cards 12VP
Battle Ready Army 10VP 10VP
* If using Fixed Missions, 20VP maximum per Fixed Mission card.
** You cannot score more than 90VP for your Primary Mission,
Secondary Missions and Challenger cards combined.
```
**DESIGNER’S NOTES**

**VP FOR DESTROYING MODELS OR UNITS**
Some cards award VP for destroying enemy models or units. If
you gain VP as described on such cards, you retain those VP even
if those destroyed models or units are subsequently returned to
the battlefield.
**VP UP TO A LIMIT**
Some cards award VP up to a stated limit, which may not be a round
multiple, e.g. ‘2VP (up to 5VP)’. In such cases, you can keep scoring
up to the stated limit, then any excess VP awarded are lost.
**DISCARDING CARDS**
Some cards begin with a section named ‘ When Drawn’, which details
immediate next steps including when such cards either can or must
be discarded. Note that if such a card is a Secondary Mission card,
this section only applies if you are using Tactical Missions.
**HOW MANY UNITS CAN PERFORM THE SAME ACTION?**
If an Action’s Units section places a limit on the number of units that
can perform it, this means that only that number of units from your
army can be performing that Action at any one time.

```

**Q:** _If a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, and that
Attached unit was performing an Action, can the remaining unit(s) in
that Attached unit still complete that Action?_
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** _If my opponent selects an Attached unit for the Marked for Death
Secondary Mission, which units forming that Attached unit must I
destroy to score VP?_
**A:** To score VP, you must destroy the Bodyguard unit and at least
one of the Leader units that was at tached to it. For example, if your
opponent selects a unit of Boyz led by a Warboss and a Weirdboy,
and you destroy that Boyz unit so that the Warboss and Weirdboy
each become individual units, you must also destroy either that
Warboss or that Weirdboy (or one of them must be removed from the
bat tlefield for any other reason) to score VP from Marked for Death.

**Q:** _When selecting units for the Marked for Death Secondary Mission,
can I select a Leader within an Attached unit?_
**A:** No.

**Q:** _When performing the Terraform Action, can I terraform an objective
marker my opponent has already terraformed?_
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** _In the Burden of Trust Primary Mission, how many times can each
player score VP for guarding an objective marker they control?_
**A.** The player going first can score VP for guarding an objective
marker they control at the end of their opponent’s first, second,
third, four th and fif th turn. The player going second can score VP
for guarding an objective marker they control at the end of their
opponent’s second, third, four th and fif th turn.

**Q:** _When setting up objective markers as part of step 4 of the Chapter
Approved Tournament Mission Sequence, or setting up a new
objective marker as part of a Primary Mission (such as The Ritual), do
I measure from/to the centre or the edge of the objective marker?_
**A:** In all of these instances, you measure from the centre of the
objective marker. This also includes the central objective marker
in the Search and Destroy deployment map when measuring the
boundaries of the deployment zones.

**Q:** _To start performing the Sabotage Action, does it require both the
terrain feature and your unit to not be within your deployment zone?
Or is it just your unit that must not be within your deployment zone?_
**A:** Only your unit must not be within your deployment zone to star t
performing the Sabotage Action.

**Q:** _In Burden of Trust, can you guard objective markers in your own
deployment zone?_
**A:** Yes.

**Q:** _For Primary and Secondary Missions that award VP for destroying_
**Character** _models or units, if those models or units are returned
to the battlefield and then subsequently destroyed again, will
such Primary and Secondary Missions award VP for them being
destroyed again?_
**A:** Yes, unless that Primary or Secondary Mission specifies other wise.

```
Q: For the purposes of the Mission Pack, are there any amendments
to the Core Rules regarding how Ruins affect charging units and
which models can fight?
A: No. This means models can be positioned to make it difficult to
charge directly through sections of terrain features into combat, as
models can’t end their Charge move where any par t of their model
or base would be within sections of those terrain features (e.g. a
solid Ruins wall). This may mean the result of a Charge roll needs to
be greater to allow a unit to make a Charge move that ends within
Engagement Range and not within any sections of those terrain
features, while still following all other conditions of charging.
Designer’s Note: Organisers, if your terrain collection includes
large enclosed structures that units would be able to move within,
but may render ending a Charge move within Engagement Range of
those units within that terrain impossible, you may wish to include
additional clarification for your particular terrain elements within
your event packs to avoid uninteractive situations.

**CARD AMENDMENTS FOR TOURNAMENTS**


**The 20 Chapter Approved Tournament Missions in this section are designed to act as a pool from which organisers can build
their events, selecting from it in random order. Further commentary on these is given below.**

**PRIMARY MISSIONS**
The Chapter Approved Mission Deck includes 10 Primary Missions,
for the best balanced experience we have used a mix of 7 of these
Primary Missions for organisers to build their events. We recommend
selecting options that span a variety of different Primary Missions, to
provide different challenges for the players to adapt to.

For those running longer-format events, or whose at tendees are
par ticularly expectant of a perfectly balanced mission every time,
we have included the more straightfor ward Primary Missions in a
greater number of configurations.

```
RECOMMENDED TERRAIN LAYOUTS
When using the recommended terrain layouts in this pack, please
note the layouts best suited for each deployment mode, as shown
in the table below. We recommend structuring your mission order to
facilitate any changes to terrain layouts you will need to make during
your event, if, as the organiser, you choose to set up the tables for
the players.

#### TERRAIN LAYOUTS

**The following battlefield recommendations are intended primarily for newer organisers and those looking for a steer in building
up a terrain collection for regular tournament play. These layouts will be seen at most Games Workshop matched play events,
and reflect the type of terrain density that creates risk-and-reward decisions that a wide variety of army types can engage
with. They are by no means the only way to set up a battlefield for balanced play, but represent a reliable starting point when
in doubt.**

These are the terrain layouts we use for balance and internal testing
within the Warhammer Design Studio. We feel they reflect how a
bat tlefield should look for balanced play in the current edition of
Warhammer 40,000.

They are by no means the only way to set up a bat tlefield for
balanced play, but represent a reliable star ting point when in doubt.
These layouts were designed with a few key principles in mind:

**RECOMMENDED MEASUREMENTS**
For all of the bat tlefield recommendations we use a combination of
three different sizes of area terrain outlines:

```
AREA TERRAIN SIZE QUANTITY
6" x 4" 4
10" x 5" 2
12" x 6" 6
```
Using the area terrain outlines detailed above, all of the bat tlefield
recommendations have preset measurements provided. This
allows for organisers to easily set up the tables, or allow the players
themselves to set up their own tables at the beginning of each round.

```
OBJECTIVE MARKERS
Objective markers can and sometimes will be either hidden within
terrain or placed in the open.
USE OF RUINS
The following layouts primarily use the Ruins terrain feature.
This efficiently achieves a good amount of line-of-sight blockage
and cover appropriate for balanced games, thanks to the natural
abstraction of line of sight within the rules for Ruins. Remember that
a variety of terrain heights not only adds to the immersive nature of
the bat tlefield, but is also impor tant for line of sight and rules such
as Plunging Fire. For organisers and players with a more robust
terrain collection (especially elements that block true line of sight),
incorporating features such as Woods, Barricades and Hills into your
chosen layouts is perfectly acceptable.
```
```
TERRAIN KEY – SUGGESTED TERRAIN HEIGHT
MORE THAN 4"
2" OR LESS
```
```
For model mobility purposes, we have shaded the area terrain
outlines in the above colours to show our recommendations
for how tall the terrain should be in each section.
Below are examples of Ruins terrain placements within area
terrain sections, as well as icons that denote if connected
area terrain outlines are a single area terrain section or
separate area terrain sections when determining line of sight.
These height and Ruin placement guidelines help provide a
balanced tournament experience; as organisers you are free
to adjust this to suit your terrain collection.

#### PAIRINGS AND R ANKINGS

There are countless different ways in which a Warhammer organised
play event can be run. While broad-stroke concepts like pairing
off players with the same record are straightfor ward enough, the
nuance of running a successful Warhammer tournament is the
subject of continuous conversation and evolution. The following
recommendations are once again for newer organisers who are still
establishing their principles and best practices, to help improve the
average experience at any Warhammer tournament. These principles
are also followed at most official Games Workshop events, and are
designed to create the fairest, most fun experience possible for
every at tendee, regardless of standing.

**PAIRING PL AYERS**
While the first round of most tournaments is randomly paired,
subsequent round pairing can be done in a number of ways. The first
pairing metric will almost always be player record, i.e. pairing a 3-
player with another 3-1 player, and so on. Given that most rounds will
include numerous players with the same record, however, deciding
pairings beyond this metric can be quite nuanced, and the different
methods available can have significant impacts on the experience
of players at an event. We recommend pairing players by the
following criteria:

■ **First** – by record (i.e. the number of wins, losses and draws)
■ **Second –** by win path (i.e. the timing of the rounds in which a player
won or lost their games)
■ **Third –** randomly within players of the same ranking

```
RANKING PLAYERS
In many tournaments, the overall Best General will be the single
remaining undefeated player at the end of the event. Sometimes,
however, there are not enough rounds available to determine a single
undefeated player, and players of ten wish to know their ranking
regardless of whether they won the whole event. To help break
ties between players who end an event with the same record, we
recommend ranking players by the following criteria:
■ First – by overall record (wins, losses and draws)
■ Second – by their opponents’ win records (i.e. those with more wins
against opponents with better win records would place higher)
■ Third – by total Victory points (VP)
Designer’s Note: Traditionally, many organisers use total VP or VP
differential to determine ranking. However, the number of VP scored
within any one game of Warhammer 40,000 rarely tells a clear story
about how close that game actually was. Often, a more challenging
opponent will be harder to score against (and thus yield a lower
score despite the victory being all the more hard-earned), or the
nature of how the two armies match up may dictate a risky strategy
that doesn’t pay off (and thus yield a wide score disparity despite
almost working out).
As such, we do not recommend using VP as a pairing metric, nor as a
ranking metric until all other metrics have been exhausted, or when
further tie-breaking is required (e.g. in larger events where identical
rankings become more likely). By contrast, opponent win record is
an ideal metric, because when two players end up with the same
record, the overall skill of their opponents is a better indicator of
Win Path which player had the more challenging path along the way.
A player ’s ‘win path’ refers not to their number of wins and
losses, but to the timing of those wins and losses. While
pairing by win path has an incidental tendency to pair people
by strength of schedule, its greatest impact is on the overall
enjoyment experienced by all players, as it tends to pair
players based upon shared experience.
For example, let’s take two 3-1 players. One of them lost their
first game; they likely lowered their expectations for winning
the whole event af ter this, but are probably in a great mood
af ter three consecutive victories. The other won their first three
games then lost their four th – a sharp disappointment af ter a
3-0 star t. Should these players face off, their shared enjoyment
may be at odds as they are in very different emotional places.
Win path ensures players enter their match with recent
common experiences upon which to build a friendship during
their next game of Warhammer.

The Rules Commentary, Errata and FAQ
There are myriad ways to enjoy the Warhammer hobby,
and these all manifest themselves at a tournament: gif ted
hobbyists with beautiful armies, skilled competitors aiming for
Best General, casual players looking to face new opponents
and make new friends (by far the most common type of
at tendee), and even practitioners of the niche hobby of Rules
Lawyer! These par ticular hobbyists of ten find unusual rules
interactions at the very fringes of Warhammer 40,000, which
can create interesting challenges for tournament organisers
looking to provide clear answers and an easy gaming
experience for their at tendees. For the current edition, the
Warhammer Design Studio has created its most robust and
comprehensive Rules Commentary, Errata and FAQ to date.
Available to download on warhammer-community.com, these
living documents will be reviewed periodically to clarify any
issues that may be causing uncer tainty. Should an odd rules
interaction come up during your event and the Core Rules
do not provide a clear answer, we recommend consulting
these resources.

#### AFTERWORD

**WHAT IS THE POINT OF A
WARHAMMER TOURNAMENT?**
Warhammer is more popular than ever, and this popularity has
extended to the tournament scene. Over the last few years, more
than one million games of Warhammer 40,000 were played in
tournaments around the world, and that grow th will only continue
in the future. With so many Warhammer hobbyists par ticipating in
the game within growing communities, it’s impor tant to ruminate
on the point of a tournament. First and foremost, it is not about
celebrating the ultimate victor; someone who goes undefeated
and wins Best General needs very lit tle acclaim beyond the
outcome itself (af ter all, they won!). Instead, it is the experience
of every single at tendee that truly mat ters, and the recognition
that, for most people who at tend a tournament, community and
friendship are both the purpose and the outcome.

Before you roll a single dice against an opponent to star t your
tournament experience, remember two things:

**1)** The person across the table from you shares your love
of Warhammer.

**2)** By the time the dust set tles on the event, almost everyone will
have lost a game (typically, at most, only one or two people will
manage to leave the event without a loss).

While any game of ten yields winners and losers on the tabletop,
the magic of Warhammer in an event set ting is the oppor tunity
it provides every par ticipant to become a bigger par t of the
Warhammer community, and to build friendships with fellow
hobbyists that can last a lifetime. As an organiser or a player, if
you focus on this inalienable truth, then while most of you will
have lost a game or two, you’ll all share victory in your experience
of what it is to at tend a Warhammer event.

# BASE SIZE GUIDE

## LAST UPDATED: JUNE 2025

**Welcome to the Warhammer 40,000 Base Size Guide. This document contains the most up-to-date base sizes appropriate
for all Warhammer 40,000 models that can be used in matched play.**

Tournaments bring together people from all over the world to
enjoy a shared hobby, to play the game we love using armies we
have spent many hours building and painting. Many players
enjoy converting and customising their models to make them
unique and personal to them, and we actively encourage this.

One of the key goals of a tournament is to provide a shared
fair play experience for all, while celebrating the hobby.
To support tournament organisers in achieving this, this
document gathers a list of appropriate base sizes for all players
to check. This information is not a requirement for all games of
Warhammer 40,000, but is intended to avoid any uncertainty
that may arise in matched play settings.

```
Designer’s Note: A few of the very largest models listed in this
document are marked as Unique. Such models do not fit on any
Citadel base of standard size, so if you intend to use any of these
models at an event, we recommend you speak to the tournament
organiser to agree with them what base size is appropriate.
