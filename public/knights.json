When such a unit is selected to shoot, it can only resolve attacks using its Pistols and can only target one of the enemy units it is within Engagement Range of. In such circumstances, a Pistol can target an enemy unit even if other friendly units are within Engagement Range of the same enemy unit. \n\nIf a model is equipped with one or more Pistols, unless it is a **^^Monster^^** or **^^Vehicle^^** model, it can either shoot with its Pistols or with all of its other ranged weapons. Declare whether such a model will shoot with its Pistols or its other ranged weapons before selecting targets.","id":"8bf7-8812-923d-29e4","name":"Pistol","hidden":false,"page":25}],"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"12\"","name":"Range","typeId":"9896-9419-16a1-92fc"},{"$text":"1","name":"A","typeId":"3bb-c35f-f54-fb08"},{"$text":"3+","name":"BS","typeId":"94d-8a98-cf90-183e"},{"$text":"4","name":"S","typeId":"2229-f494-25db-c5d3"},{"$text":"0","name":"AP","typeId":"9ead-8a10-520-de15"},{"$text":"1","name":"D","typeId":"a354-c1c8-a745-f9e3"},{"$text":"Pistol","name":"Keywords","typeId":"7f1b-8591-2fcf-d01c"}],"id":"2157-1926-df10-90f8","name":"Bolt pistol","hidden":false,"typeId":"f77d-b953-8fa4-b762","typeName":"Ranged Weapons","from":"entry"}],"id":"me4p19zrl01uwrobgfe","name":"Bolt pistol","entryId":"d206-2f04-665a-eb01::eca2-431b-1cad-5e76::5314-726f-72ba-9014","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"entry"},{"profiles":[{"characteristics":[{"$text":"Melee","name":"Range","typeId":"914c-b413-91e3-a132"},{"$text":"1","name":"A","typeId":"2337-daa1-6682-b110"},{"$text":"4+","name":"WS","typeId":"95d1-95f-45b4-11d6"},{"$text":"3","name":"S","typeId":"ab33-d393-96ce-ccba"},{"$text":"-1","name":"AP","typeId":"41a0-1301-112a-e2f2"},{"$text":"1","name":"D","typeId":"3254-9fe6-d824-513e"},{"$text":"-","name":"Keywords","typeId":"893f-9000-ccf7-648e"}],"id":"9522-b10f-5943-435d","name":"Close combat weapon","hidden":false,"typeId":"8a40-4aaa-c780-9046","typeName":"Melee Weapons","from":"entry"}],"id":"me4p19zriguxxsq6d0i","name":"Close combat weapon","entryId":"d206-2f04-665a-eb01::531d-2f27-4744-7a8c::5966-8ea2-54a-1edb","number":1,"type":"upgrade","from":"entry"},{"rules":[{"description":"Weapons with **[MELTA X]** in their profile are known as Melta weapons.
